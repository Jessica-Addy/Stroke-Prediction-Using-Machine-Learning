# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning:  Identifying Key RiskFactors
# 👩‍⚕️ Project Overview
Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, making early identification of high-risk individuals critical. This study investigates how machine learning (ML) can enhance stroke risk prediction in real-world scenarios characterized by limited and imbalanced data. Using models such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, the study classifies stroke cases and identifies key risk factors, providing insights that can support clinical decision-making and early preventive interventions.

# 🎯 Goals
- Develop robust machine learning models capable of predicting stroke risk using small, imbalanced datasets.
- Identify key features and risk factors influencing stroke occurrence.
- Enhance model interpretability to support clinical decision-making.
- Evaluate whether complex ML models outperform a simple logistic regression baseline.
- Reduce false negatives through appropriate handling of class imbalance.


# 🗂️ Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imaadmahmood/stroke-risk-synthetic-2025)
- Size: 5110 records
- Features: age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and stroke occurrence.
⚠️ Only 4% of patients had a stroke, making class imbalance a major challenge.
